In fact it is \r\nrecommended to do so. Allowing people to run arbitrary code on the machine which runs\r\nyour webserver is generally a bad idea.\r\n\r\n1. `./setup.sh` does most of the work for you.\r\n2. Set the SLAVE_ADDRESSES in settings.py by default it is set to 127.0.0.1:9000\r\n3. Run the webserver. I usually set up using gunicorn and nginx. `./runserver.sh`\r\n4. Run the check server by executing the slave.py file `./runslave.sh`\r\n\r\nThe webserver is set up as a standard django server. I prefer using Nginx,Gunicorn as a \r\ncombination. Check my [blog](http://arjoonn.blogspot.com/2015/05/django-gunicorn-and-nginx.html) for how to set that up.\r\n\r\nNote that the slave will have to run on a linux like machine. I shamelessly used redirection\r\nand I have no idea how they translate on a windows box if they do at all.\r\n\r\nUsage during the competition\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Register users with `python add_user.py` using a python shell at the registration desk.\r\n   the file can be found in `./openJudge/webserver/`\r\n2. Run the webserver. Run the check server. Use above instructions\r\n3. Tell everyone to navigate to the webserver. It will be something like `192.168.1.45`\r\n4. Enjoy the fruits of watching a hundred people program.\r\n\r\nI recommend a virtualenv with all the requirements satisfied.\r\n```\r\nvirtualenv -p python3 env\r\nsource env/bin/activate\r\npip install -r requirements-dev.txt\r\n```\r\nThen again `setup.sh` takes care of this stuff for you.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
